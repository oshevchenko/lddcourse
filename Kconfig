	  Tktest is useful to connect slow 1-pin devices
	  such as iButtons and thermal sensors.

	  If you want Tktest support, you should say Y here.

	  This Tktest support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called wire.

	  This allows to communicate with userspace using connector. For more
	  information see <file:Documentation/connector/connector.txt>.
	  There are three types of messages between w1 core and userspace:
	  1. Events. They are generated each time new master or slave device found
		either due to automatic or requested search.
	  2. Userspace commands. Includes read/write and search/alarm search commands.
	  3. Replies to userspace commands.
